the reason this took so long is bc i had about 5 mental breakdowns today.
<P>I can't believe I have never dedicated a blog post to my number one icon; Buffy Summers. The character turned 40 on the 19th January, which also happens to be the anniversary of my Dad passing away. And to me, the fact those dates aligned, is very significant. Buffy has been my symbol of strength for many years of my life, and she grows a year older on one of the days I need her strength the most. I feel so fortunate to have grown up watching Buffy. I was too young to watch the early seasons as they aired, but Mum used to buy me the VHS boxsets from Woolworths as we then watched through them together. I rotated through the characters and which one I wanted to be. I even got my Dad to once make me a wooden stake, only to be then told off when I was trying to sleep with it under my pillow incase of any vampires I might need to slay. I begged Mum to buy me a long leather coat from a catalogue shop (it was a no), but did manage to get a brilliant tennis dress from Matalan similar to one Cordelia once wore. I idolised all the female characters at different points, but of course always came back to Buffy. And over 15 years on from when I first saw the series, she is still my greatest idol. It could be all too easy to overlook the significance a TV show, band, or celebrity can have on your life. But at any age, when you find something you relate to strongly, it can be so impactful. And I believe Buffy is the greatest example of that, especially as every time I re-watch the series, I feel her character growing with me. Her significance in my life has never waned.
